# Challenge
Given an input stream. Goal is to parse the stream, keep the track of the count of each distinct word encountered.
-- solution should utilize parallelism, multithreading, e.g. at a time we can have multiple threads consuming the input from the stream and updating the data.
-- once the stram is exausted we should print the each word with the count.
